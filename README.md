# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection

The importance of this project lies in addressing the pressing issue of drowsy driving, which poses a
significant threat to road safety worldwide. Despite numerous advancements in transportation
technology, the challenge of detecting and mitigating drowsiness among drivers remains a critical
concern. Current available solutions often fall short in accurately identifying and preempting instances
of driver fatigue, leaving drivers vulnerable to the risks associated with impaired alertness while
operating vehicles. Moreover, existing methods lack comprehensive approaches to effectively assess and address the
multifaceted nature of drowsiness-related risks. 
This project seeks to bridge these gaps by leveraging
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to develop a robust and proactive system for detecting and
managing driver drowsiness. By employing sophisticated algorithms and techniques, such as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the proposed solution aims to enhance the accuracy and
reliability of drowsiness detection, thereby reducing the incidence of drowsy driving-related accidents
